UPDATE:
UI has been added with images of rock paper and scissors for user to select.
The score of the player and computer is tracked at the top.
The round count and output of the round details is appended to an OL below the score
Once a score reaches 5, a message appends above the list(to top to avoid scrolling) indicating the winner.
If the user wins, the message background is green. Otherwise it is red.
